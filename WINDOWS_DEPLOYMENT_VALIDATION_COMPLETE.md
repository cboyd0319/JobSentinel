## Issues Found and Resolved

### 1. Path Reference Issues ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Would prevent deployment from working  

**Issue:**
- Multiple files referenced non-existent path `deploy/common/launcher_gui.py`
- Actual file location is `deploy/common/app/src/jsa/gui_launcher.py`

**Files Fixed:**
- `.github/workflows/test-windows-deployment.yml` (3 references)
- `.github/workflows/test-macos-deployment.yml` (3 references)

**Solution:**
Updated all references to use correct path or module import (`python -m jsa.gui_launcher`)

### 2. Config Directory Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Tests would fail, deployment validation incorrect

**Issue:**
- Tests expected config at repository root (`config/`)
- Actual location is `deploy/common/config/`

**Files Fixed:**
- `deploy/common/tests/test_windows_deployment.py` (5 references)

**Solution:**
Updated all config path references to use correct deployment structure

### 3. Validation Script Paths ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Validation script would report false failures

**Issue:**
- Validation script checked for files at old locations
- File structure checks needed updating for new deployment layout

**Files Fixed:**
- `deploy/common/scripts/validate_windows_deployment.ps1`

**Solution:**
Updated all file existence checks to use correct deployment paths
