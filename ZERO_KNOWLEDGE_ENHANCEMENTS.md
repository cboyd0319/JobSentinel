## What Was Built

### 1. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Launcher 🖱️

**File:** `launcher_gui.py` (554 lines)

**Problem Solved:** 
- Users were intimidated by command-line interfaces
- Non-technical users couldn't use JobSentinel at all
- Windows users needed command-line knowledge

**Solution:**
- Beautiful tkinter-based GUI with intuitive buttons
- One-click start/stop server functionality
- Visual status indicators (Python, config, database, server)
- Activity log viewer with real-time feedback
- Integrated setup wizard launcher
- Config file editor with one-click access
- Help documentation accessible from GUI

**Launch Methods:**
```bash
# Windows - Just double-click!
launch-gui.bat

# Or PowerShell
.\launch-gui.ps1

# Or direct Python
python launcher_gui.py
```

**Unique Selling Points:**
- ✅ NO other job search tool has zero-command-line GUI
- ✅ Works without admin rights (corporate PCs)
- ✅ Uses only tkinter (comes with Python)
- ✅ 800x600 friendly interface
- ✅ Real-time activity logging

### 2. Email Notification System 📧

**File:** `src/jsa/notify_email.py` (485 lines)

**Problem Solved:**
- Slack-only notifications excluded non-technical users
- Not everyone has or wants Slack
- Email is more universal and accessible

**Solution:**
- Multi-provider support (Gmail, Outlook, Office365, Yahoo)
- Beautiful HTML email templates with job cards
- Plain text fallback for compatibility
- Digest mode (batch multiple jobs in one email)
- App password security guidance
- Connection testing before sending
- Comprehensive error messages with fixes

**Providers Supported:**
- Gmail (most common)
- Outlook/Hotmail

- Job scores displayed prominently (85% match)
- One-click "View Job" buttons
- Salary ranges and remote indicators
- Company and location details
- Privacy footer

**Usage:**

from jsa.notify_email import EmailNotifier

# Simple usage
notifier = EmailNotifier(provider="gmail")
notifier.send_job_alert(jobs)

# Or convenience function
from jsa.notify_email import send_job_email
send_job_email(jobs, provider="gmail", digest=True)
```

**Unique Selling Points:**
- ✅ ONLY tool with Email + Slack (dual-channel)
- ✅ Multi-provider support (vs single provider)
- ✅ Beautiful HTML emails (vs plain text)
- ✅ Digest mode reduces inbox clutter
