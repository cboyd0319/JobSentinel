# Job Scraper - Future Enhancements & Roadmap

This document tracks planned features, improvements, and technical debt for the Job Scraper project.

## Priority: HIGH (Next Release)

### Resume Parser for Auto-Config
**Status**: Not Started
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Description**: Allow users to upload their resume (PDF/DOCX) and automatically extract:
- Skills (Python, AWS, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Job titles/roles (Software Engineer, DevOps, etc.)
- Companies (current/past employers to potentially filter or prioritize)
- Education level
- Years of experience

**Implementation**:
- Add `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` for PDF parsing
- Add `python-docx` for Word document parsing
- Use regex + NLP (spaCy?) to extract structured data
- Auto-populate `config/user_prefs.json` with extracted values
- Prompt user to review/edit before saving

**Files to modify**:
- `cloud/providers/gcp/gcp.py`: Add resume upload prompt in `_collect_configuration()`
- `cloud/utils.py`: Add `parse_resume()` function
- `requirements.txt`: Add parsing dependencies

**User Flow**:
```
[Deployment Script]
‚Üí "Would you like to upload your resume for automatic configuration? (y/n)"
‚Üí [User provides resume.pdf path]
‚Üí [Script extracts skills, titles, companies]
‚Üí "Found skills: Python, Docker, AWS. Add more? (y/n)"
‚Üí [Generate user_prefs.json with extracted data]
‚Üí [Continue with deployment]
```

## Priority: MEDIUM (v2.0)

### Multi-Cloud Support
**Status**: Planned
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks per cloud
**Description**: Extend deployment to AWS and Azure

#### AWS Implementation
- Lambda Functions (batch processing)
- EventBridge Scheduler
- S3 for storage
- Secrets Manager
- CloudWatch Logs & Alarms
- Terraform modules in `terraform/aws/`

#### Azure Implementation
- Azure Functions (container instances)
- Logic Apps for scheduling
- Blob Storage
- Key Vault
- Application Insights
- Terraform modules in `terraform/azure/`

### Local Machine Deployment
**Status**: Planned
**Effort**: 1 week
**Description**: Support running entirely on user's local machine (no cloud required)

**Implementation**:
- Cron/Task Scheduler for scheduling
- Local SQLite database for job tracking
- File-based secret storage (encrypted)
- Systemd/launchd/Windows Service for daemon mode

---

## Priority: LOW (Nice to Have)

### Web Dashboard
**Status**: Idea
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Description**: Simple web UI for monitoring and configuration

**Features**:
- View recent job matches
- Adjust filters/preferences
- View scraping logs
- Deployment status
- Cost metrics (for cloud deployments)

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Auth: OAuth2 (Google/GitHub)
- Hosting: Cloud Run (serverless)

### AI-Powered Job Matching
**Status**: Idea
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks
**Description**: Use LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic) to better score job matches

**Features**:
- Semantic similarity between resume and job description
- "Why this matches" explanations
- Red flags detection (unrealistic requirements, low pay, etc.)
- Company culture fit analysis (from Glassdoor data)

**Concerns**:
- Cost (API calls per job listing)
- Privacy (sending job descriptions to external API)
- Rate limiting

### Mobile App
**Status**: Idea
**Effort**: 4-6 weeks
**Description**: Native iOS/Android app for job notifications

**Features**:
- Push notifications for high-scoring jobs
- Swipe interface (Tinder-style job browsing)
- Quick apply integration
- Interview prep assistant
