## Usage Examples

### Quick Start

```python
# Detection
from domains.detection import JobQualityDetector, ResumeQualityDetector, SkillsGapAnalyzer

# Job analysis
detector = JobQualityDetector()
result = detector.analyze(job_title, job_description, company, salary_range)
print(f"Quality: {result.overall_score}/100 ({result.quality_level.value})")

# Resume analysis
detector = ResumeQualityDetector()
result = detector.analyze(resume_text, target_industry, target_role)
print(f"Quality: {result.overall_score}/100")
print(f"Improvement potential: +{result.improvement_potential}")

# Skills gap
analyzer = SkillsGapAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze(current_skills, target_role, target_industry, years)
print(f"Match: {result.overall_match_score}%")
```

```python
# Auto-Fix
from domains.autofix import ResumeAutoFixer, BulletEnhancer, KeywordOptimizer

# Auto-fix resume
fixer = ResumeAutoFixer()
result = fixer.auto_fix(resume_text, target_keywords, aggressive=True)
print(f"Improvement: +{result.improvement_score}%")

# Enhance bullets
enhancer = BulletEnhancer()
result = enhancer.enhance("Worked on backend development")
print(f"Enhanced: {result.enhanced}")
print(f"Improvement: +{result.improvement_score}%")

# Optimize keywords
optimizer = KeywordOptimizer()
result = optimizer.optimize(resume_text, job_description)
print(f"Optimization: {result.optimization_score}%")
print(f"Missing: {', '.join(result.missing_keywords[:5])}")
```

### Integration Example

```python
# Complete workflow
from domains.detection import ResumeQualityDetector
from domains.autofix import ResumeAutoFixer, BulletEnhancer

# Step 1: Analyze current resume
detector = ResumeQualityDetector()
quality = detector.analyze(resume_text)
print(f"Initial quality: {quality.overall_score}/100")

# Step 2: Auto-fix issues
fixer = ResumeAutoFixer()
fixed = fixer.auto_fix(resume_text, aggressive=True)
print(f"Improvement: +{fixed.improvement_score}%")

# Step 3: Enhance specific bullets
enhancer = BulletEnhancer()
enhanced_bullets = enhancer.enhance_batch(extract_bullets(fixed.fixed_text))

# Step 4: Re-analyze
final_quality = detector.analyze(apply_enhancements(fixed.fixed_text, enhanced_bullets))
print(f"Final quality: {final_quality.overall_score}/100")
print(f"Total improvement: +{final_quality.overall_score - quality.overall_score}")
