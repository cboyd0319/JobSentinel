## üü¢ Before You Start

| Requirement | How to check | What to do if missing |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| macOS 12 Monterey or newer (Sonoma/Sequoia recommended) | Ô£ø > **About This Mac** | Update via System Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Software Update |
| Python 3.11 or 3.12 | Double-click **Check Python.command** (or run `python3 --version`) | Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install python@3.12` |
| 1 GB free disk space | Ô£ø > **About This Mac** > More Info > Storage | Delete or move files to free up space |
| Internet connection | Open a website in Safari | Connect to Wi‚ÄëFi or Ethernet |

> üí° **Tip:** If you are unsure whether Python is installed, run the setup anyway ‚Äî JobSentinel will guide you through fixing it.

## üöÄ Zero-Knowledge Quick Start (Double-Click Flow)

1. **Open the JobSentinel folder** (from your download or clone).
2. **Double-click `setup.command`.**
   - The script walks through all checks, creates a private `.venv` environment, installs dependencies, and runs an interactive preference wizard.
   - Grab a coffee ‚òï ‚Äî this takes about 5 minutes on a typical MacBook.
3. When the setup finishes you will see new shortcuts on your Desktop:
   - `Run JobSentinel.command`
   - `JobSentinel Dashboard.command`
   - `Configure JobSentinel.command`
   - `JobSentinel Launcher.command` (opens the graphical control panel)
4. **Launch JobSentinel** by double-clicking `JobSentinel Launcher.command`.
   - The GUI lets you run searches, open the dashboard, and monitor system health with buttons ‚Äî no commands required.

## üîç What the Setup Wizard Does Automatically

- Verifies macOS version, Python availability, disk space, and internet access.
- Creates/refreshes a dedicated `.venv` virtual environment so the system Python stays untouched.
- Installs all required Python packages (with automatic pip upgrades).
- Downloads Playwright Chromium for the built-in scrapers.
- Runs the JobSentinel configuration wizard so you can enter skills, preferred locations, salary targets, etc.
- Performs a health check to confirm everything works.
- Drops friendly `.command` launchers on your Desktop plus shell aliases like `jobsentinel-run`.

> üîê **Privacy first:** Everything stays on your Mac. No cloud services, no telemetry.

## üÜò Troubleshooting (Friendly Fixes)

| "Permission denied" when double-clicking scripts | Right-click the script ‚Üí Open With ‚Üí Terminal once, or run `chmod +x *.command` inside the folder. |
| Python not found during setup | Install Python via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or run `brew install python@3.12`. Then double-click `setup.command` again. |
| Setup stuck downloading dependencies | Check Wi‚ÄëFi, then re-run `setup.command`. The wizard resumes where it left off. |
| GUI fails to launch | Run `JobSentinel Health Check.command` to see diagnostics. |
