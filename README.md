**Job hunting sucks.** You know it. We know it.

Endless scrolling. Reposted ghost jobs. Missing the perfect role because you were sleeping.
Companies harvesting your data while you search.

**JobSentinel fixes all of that.**

## What Does JobSentinel Actually Do?

**It's like having a tireless assistant who searches for jobs 24/7 and only bothers you when something great comes up.**

Here's the deal:

1. **You tell it what you want** — job titles, salary, remote/hybrid/onsite
2. **It watches 13 job boards for you** — checking every 2 hours, day and night
3. **It scores every job** — so you only see roles that actually match
4. **It alerts you instantly** — Slack, Discord, Teams, Email, or just a desktop notification

That's it. No accounts. No subscriptions. No data harvesting. Just... jobs that match what you want.

## Why JobSentinel?

### The Job Search Is Rigged Against You

| The Problem | How JobSentinel Fixes It |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Job sites sell your data** | Your data never leaves your computer. Period. |
| **You miss jobs while sleeping** | JobSentinel watches 13 job boards 24/7 and pings you instantly |
| **Half the listings are ghost jobs** | Built-in ghost detection flags fake, stale, and already-filled positions |
| **Applications take forever** | One-click apply fills forms automatically (you still click Submit) |
| **You're guessing at salary** | Salary AI shows real market rates from public government data |
| **Subscription fatigue** | **Free forever.** No premium tier. No "upgrade to unlock." |

### What Makes It Special

**13 Job Boards, One Dashboard**

- Greenhouse, Lever, LinkedIn, Indeed, RemoteOK, Wellfound, WeWorkRemotely
- BuiltIn, Dice, HN Who's Hiring, JobsWithGPT, YC Startup Jobs, ZipRecruiter
- New jobs every 2 hours (or whenever you want)

**Ghost Job Detection**

- Spots fake listings, reposted jobs, and positions that are already filled
- Color-coded warnings so you don't waste time applying

**Smart Scoring**

- Every job gets a match score based on YOUR preferences
- Skills (40%) + Salary (25%) + Location (20%) + Company (10%) + Freshness (5%)

**Resume Builder + ATS Optimizer**

- Build professional resumes with 5 templates
- ATS (Applicant Tracking System) is software companies use to filter resumes — we help you pass those filters
- See exactly which keywords you're missing before you apply
- Export to Word (.docx) ready to upload

**One-Click Apply**

- Fills out Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, and 4 other application systems
- You review everything and click Submit yourself
- Stores your info locally so you never type it again

**Application Tracking**

- Kanban board to track every application
- Automatic reminders for follow-ups
- Interview prep checklists

**100% Private**

- Runs entirely on your computer
- No cloud. No accounts. No tracking.
- We literally cannot see your data

**Keyboard-First Design**

Power users can navigate entirely by keyboard:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `k` | Navigate job list (down/up) |
| `o` | Open selected job |
| `b` | Bookmark job |
| `h` | Hide job |
| `n` | Add note |
| `/` | Focus search |
| `?` | Show all shortcuts |
| `Ctrl+1-7` | Switch pages |

## Get Started

### Step 1: Download

**Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel/releases):**

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| **Windows** | [JobSentinel_2.5.2_x64_en-US.msi](https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel/releases/download/v2.5.2/JobSentinel_2.5.2_x64_en-US.msi) |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon)** | [JobSentinel_2.5.2_aarch64.dmg](https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel/releases/download/v2.5.2/JobSentinel_2.5.2_aarch64.dmg) |

<details>
<summary><strong>Or build from source</strong></summary>
<br>

```bash
# 1. Install Rust (if you don't have it)
# Visit: https://rustup.rs and follow the instructions

# 2. Install Node.js 20+ (if you don't have it)
# Visit: https://nodejs.org

# 3. Download and build JobSentinel
git clone https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel
cd JobSentinel
npm install
npm run tauri:build

# 4. Find your installer in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

</details>

**That's it.** The app is ~10MB and runs without admin rights.

<details>
<summary><strong>First time on Mac? (Gatekeeper warning)</strong></summary>
<br>

macOS may show "JobSentinel can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."

**To fix this:**

1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the JobSentinel message
3. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

This only happens once. JobSentinel is safe — it's open source and you can verify the code yourself.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows showing a blue warning?</strong></summary>
<br>

Windows SmartScreen may show "Windows protected your PC" because JobSentinel is new.

**To continue:**

1. Click **"More info"**
2. Click **"Run anyway"**

This is normal for new apps. JobSentinel is safe — it's open source and you can verify the code yourself.
</details>

### Step 2: Setup (2 minutes)

When you first open JobSentinel, a friendly wizard asks you four questions:

1. **What job titles are you looking for?**
   - Example: "Software Engineer", "Product Manager"

2. **Where do you want to work?**
   - Remote, Hybrid, Onsite (pick any combination)

3. **What's your minimum salary?**
   - Enter a number or $0 to see everything

4. **Want instant alerts?** (optional)
   - Connect Slack, Discord, or Teams to get pinged when great jobs appear
   - (A "webhook" is just a special URL that lets JobSentinel send messages to these apps)

Done. JobSentinel starts watching job boards immediately.

### Step 3: Let It Work

JobSentinel automatically checks all 13 job boards every 2 hours. When it finds something that matches your criteria:

- Jobs appear in your dashboard, sorted by match score
- High-scoring jobs (90%+) trigger instant notifications (if you set them up)
- Ghost jobs are flagged so you can skip them

You can also click "Search Now" anytime to run a manual scan.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this really free?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes. 100% free, forever. No subscriptions, no premium tier, no "upgrade to unlock features."

JobSentinel is open source under the MIT license. You can literally read every line of code.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to create an account?</strong></summary>
<br>
Nope. No account, no login, no cloud sync. Everything runs on your computer.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What data do you collect?</strong></summary>
<br>
<strong>Zero.</strong> Nothing. Nada.

JobSentinel has no telemetry, no analytics, no tracking. Your job search data exists only on
your computer. We couldn't see your data even if we wanted to.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor?</strong></summary>
<br>
Those are job boards that collect and sell your data. JobSentinel is a <em>tool</em> that
searches those job boards for you, privately, on your own computer.

Think of it like the difference between Google tracking your searches vs. a private search engine.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this for non-tech jobs?</strong></summary>
<br>
Absolutely! While the default settings are optimized for tech roles, JobSentinel works for any
job posted on the supported job boards.

Just change your title allowlist and keywords to match what you're looking for.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's a "ghost job"?</strong></summary>
<br>
A ghost job is a posting that isn't a real opportunity — maybe it's already filled, posted
just to collect resumes, or has been sitting there for 6 months.

JobSentinel analyzes each job and flags suspicious ones so you don't waste time applying to
dead ends.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does One-Click Apply work?</strong></summary>
<br>
You save your contact info, work history, and answers to common screening questions. When you
click "Quick Apply" on a job, JobSentinel opens the application form and fills in everything
automatically.

<strong>Important:</strong> You always review the form and click Submit yourself. JobSentinel never
submits applications without you.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is my data secure?</strong></summary>
<br>
Yes. Passwords and API tokens are stored in your operating system's secure credential manager:

- <strong>macOS:</strong> Keychain
- <strong>Windows:</strong> Credential Manager
- <strong>Linux:</strong> Secret Service (GNOME Keyring)

Your job search data is stored in a local SQLite database that only you can access.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I'm not technical. Can I still use this?</strong></summary>
<br>
Absolutely! Just download the installer for your platform (Windows or Mac), double-click, and go.
No command line or technical knowledge required.
</details>
