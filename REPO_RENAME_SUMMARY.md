## üîß Manual Steps Required (You Must Do These)

### Step 1: Rename GitHub Repository

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** GitHub repository must be manually renamed. This cannot be automated via git.

1. Go to: https://github.com/cboyd0319/job-private-scraper-filter/settings
2. Scroll to "Repository name"
3. Change from `job-private-scraper-filter` to `job-search-automation`
4. Click "Rename"

**GitHub will automatically:**
- Redirect old URLs to new URLs
- Update git remote URLs (but you should update local clone)

### Step 2: Update Repository Description

1. Go to: https://github.com/cboyd0319/job-search-automation (after rename)
2. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è icon next to "About" (top right)
3. Update description to:
   ```
   Automated job search tool with web scraping, resume matching, ATS compatibility scanner, and Slack/email notifications. Self-hosted Python job board aggregator. Deploy locally free or to cloud (GCP/AWS/Azure).
   ```
4. Click "Save changes"

### Step 3: Add Repository Topics (SEO Tags)

In the same "About" section, add these topics:
```
job-search
job-scraper
web-scraping
automation
resume-matching
ats-scanner
job-board
slack-notifications
email-notifications
python
self-hosted
gcp
aws
azure
job-hunting
career
employment
```

**Why:** GitHub uses topics for search and discovery. These will help people find your project.

### Step 4: Update Local Git Remote

After renaming on GitHub, update your local clone:

```bash
cd /Users/chadboyd/Documents/GitHub/job-private-scraper-filter

# Update remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/cboyd0319/job-search-automation.git

# Verify
git remote -v

# Optional: Rename local directory
cd ..
mv job-private-scraper-filter job-search-automation
cd job-search-automation
```

### Step 5: SEO Optimization - README.md Enhancements

   ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
   ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cboyd0319/job-search-automation)
   ```

2. **Add keywords section** (helps search engines):
   ```markdown
   ## Keywords
   job search automation | automated job search | web scraping jobs | resume matching | ATS scanner | job board aggregator | self-hosted job search | Python job scraper | Slack job alerts | email job notifications
   ```

3. **Add FAQ section** (long-tail SEO):
   ```markdown
