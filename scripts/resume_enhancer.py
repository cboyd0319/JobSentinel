## 🎯 ATS Optimization Basics

### What is an ATS?
An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is software that scans and ranks resumes before human recruiters see them. 75% of resumes never reach human eyes due to ATS filtering.

### ATS-Friendly Formatting Rules

**✅ DO:**
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
- Save as PDF (unless otherwise specified)
- Use standard section headers
- Include relevant keywords from job postings
- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep formatting simple and clean
- Use standard date formats (MM/YYYY)

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use tables, text boxes, or columns
- Include images, graphics, or charts
- Use fancy fonts or excessive formatting
- Put important information in headers/footers
- Use abbreviations without spelling out first
- Submit as image files or scanned documents

---

## 📋 Resume Structure

### Essential Sections (Required)
1. **Contact Information** - Name, phone, email, LinkedIn, location
2. **Professional Summary** - 3-4 sentence value proposition
3. **Core Competencies/Skills** - Keyword-rich skills section
4. **Professional Experience** - Work history with achievements
5. **Education** - Degrees, certifications, relevant coursework

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Mistakes
- **Generic objectives** - Use specific, value-focused summaries instead
- **Job duty lists** - Focus on achievements, not responsibilities
- **Irrelevant information** - Only include what's relevant to target role
- **Missing keywords** - Tailor each resume to job posting
- **Weak action verbs** - Use strong, specific verbs
- **No quantification** - Always include numbers when possible

### Formatting Mistakes
- **Inconsistent formatting** - Maintain consistent fonts, spacing, dates
- **Too long/short** - 1-2 pages for most professionals
- **Poor contact info** - Ensure all contact methods are current
- **Typos/errors** - Proofread multiple times
- **Unprofessional email** - Use professional email address
- **Missing links** - Include LinkedIn, portfolio links

### Strategy Mistakes
- **One-size-fits-all** - Customize for each application
- **Lying/exaggerating** - Be honest but impactful
- **Focusing on past** - Emphasize future value you'll bring
- **Ignoring ATS** - Optimize for both ATS and human readers
- **No follow-up plan** - Have strategy for after submission
