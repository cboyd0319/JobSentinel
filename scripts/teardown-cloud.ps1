.SYNOPSIS
    Windows PowerShell teardown script for Job Scraper cloud infrastructure

.DESCRIPTION
    Safely destroys all GCP cloud resources created by the Job Scraper deployment.
    Requires Terraform and gcloud CLI to be installed.

.PARAMETER Provider
    Cloud provider to tear down (currently only 'gcp' is supported)

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip confirmation prompt (dangerous!)

.EXAMPLE
    .\teardown-cloud.ps1 gcp
    Interactively tears down GCP infrastructure

.EXAMPLE
    .\teardown-cloud.ps1 gcp -Force
    Tears down GCP infrastructure without confirmation (use with caution!)
