# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

JobSentinel exists to help people find jobs. We're building this in the open because
we believe software that handles your job search data should be transparent and trustworthy.

We pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

- Being respectful and constructive in feedback
- Focusing on what's best for users and the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

**Unacceptable behavior:**

- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Spam or self-promotion unrelated to the project
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests,
discussions, and any other channels where you represent the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting
the maintainer directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that
violate this Code of Conduct, and may ban contributors for behavior they deem
inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/),
