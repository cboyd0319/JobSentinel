name: Security Scanning (PyGuard)

# PyGuard replaced Bandit and Safety for unified security scanning
# - Detects 20+ vulnerability categories (vs Bandit's ~10)
# - Includes dependency scanning via Safety integration
# - Generates SARIF output for GitHub Security tab
# - Single tool = faster CI/CD and easier maintenance
#
# NOTE: This is the AUTHORITATIVE PyGuard scan with SARIF output
# Do not add PyGuard to other workflows - it creates duplication
