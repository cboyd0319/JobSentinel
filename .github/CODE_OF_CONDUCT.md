# Code of Conduct

I want this project to be a friendly, welcoming place. A few simple rules:

- Be respectful and assume good intent.
- Give helpful feedback, not harsh criticism.
- Don't share private information about others.
- Don't be abusive, harassing, or hateful.

If something happens, please open a private issue or use GitHub's reporting tools. I'll review reports and take action as needed.

This is adapted from common open-source conduct guides â€” thanks to everyone who helps keep this project welcoming.
