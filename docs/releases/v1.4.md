# JobSentinel v1.4.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 2026
**Codename:** Ghost Hunter

## Highlights

Version 1.4 introduces **Ghost Job Detection** - an intelligent system that identifies fake, stale, or already-filled job postings so you can focus on real opportunities.

## New Features

### Ghost Job Detection

JobSentinel now analyzes every job posting for signs it may be a "ghost job":

- **Stale Detection**: Flags jobs posted 60+ days ago
- **Repost Tracking**: Identifies frequently reposted positions
- **Content Analysis**: Detects vague descriptions and generic phrases
- **Company Analysis**: Flags companies with excessive open positions
- **Requirement Analysis**: Identifies unrealistic experience requirements

Each job receives a ghost score from 0.0 (definitely real) to 1.0 (likely ghost).

### Dashboard Enhancements

- **Ghost Filter**: New dropdown to show all jobs, real jobs only, or ghost jobs only
- **Ghost Indicators**: Visual badges on job cards showing ghost probability
- **Tooltips**: Hover to see specific reasons why a job was flagged

### New Database Tables

- `job_repost_history` - Tracks job reposting patterns over time

### New API Commands

- `get_ghost_jobs` - Retrieve flagged ghost jobs
- `get_ghost_statistics` - Get aggregate detection stats
- `get_recent_jobs_filtered` - Filter jobs by ghost status

## Technical Improvements

- Added 17 new tests for ghost detection (2029 total tests)
- Ghost analysis adds ~2ms per job during scraping
- Indexed queries for fast repost lookups

## Migration

The database migration runs automatically on first launch. No manual steps required.
