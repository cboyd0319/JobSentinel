# JobSentinel v2.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** January 17, 2026

---

## Overview

**v2.0.0 is a major release** featuring:

1. **OS-native keyring integration** for secure credential storage
2. **Resume Builder & ATS Optimizer** for creating professional, ATS-compatible resumes

All sensitive credentials (API keys, passwords, webhook URLs, session cookies) are now stored
in the operating system's secure credential manager instead of plain text configuration files.

This is a **breaking change** for credential storage, with automatic migration provided for existing users.

### OS-Native Keyring Integration

All sensitive credentials are now stored in secure OS credential managers:

| Platform | Credential Manager |
|----------|-------------------|
| macOS | Keychain |
| Windows | Windows Credential Manager |
| Linux | Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet) |

### Credentials Secured

The following credentials have been migrated to secure storage:

| Credential | Used By |
|------------|---------|
| `smtp_password` | Email notifications |
| `telegram_bot_token` | Telegram notifications |
| `slack_webhook_url` | Slack notifications |
| `discord_webhook_url` | Discord notifications |
| `teams_webhook_url` | Teams notifications |
| `linkedin_session_cookie` | LinkedIn job scraper |

### New Tauri Commands

5 new commands for credential management:

```typescript
// Store a credential
await invoke("store_credential", { key: "slack_webhook_url", value: "https://..." });

// Retrieve a credential
const webhook = await invoke<string | null>("retrieve_credential", { key: "slack_webhook_url" });

// Delete a credential
await invoke("delete_credential", { key: "smtp_password" });

// Check if credential exists
const hasWebhook = await invoke<boolean>("has_credential", { key: "slack_webhook_url" });

// Get all credential statuses
const status = await invoke<Record<string, boolean>>("get_credential_status");
```

## Migration

### Automatic Migration

When JobSentinel v2.0 starts for the first time, it automatically migrates any plaintext
credentials from your config file to the secure keyring:

1. Detects credentials in `config.json`
2. Stores each credential in the OS keyring
3. Marks migration as complete
4. Credentials remain in config file (for rollback safety)

### Post-Migration Cleanup

After verifying the migration was successful, you can remove plaintext credentials from `config.json`:

```json
{
  "alerts": {
    "slack": {
      "enabled": true,
      "webhook_url": ""  // Safe to leave empty
    },
    "email": {
      "smtp_password": ""  // Safe to leave empty
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### New Module: `core/credentials/`

New credentials module with secure storage abstraction:

```rust
pub enum CredentialKey {
    SmtpPassword,
    TelegramBotToken,
    SlackWebhookUrl,
    DiscordWebhookUrl,
    TeamsWebhookUrl,
    LinkedInSessionCookie,
}

pub struct CredentialStore {
    fn store(&self, key: CredentialKey, value: &str) -> Result<()>;
    fn retrieve(&self, key: CredentialKey) -> Result<Option<String>>;
    fn delete(&self, key: CredentialKey) -> Result<()>;
    fn has(&self, key: CredentialKey) -> bool;
}
```

### Dual-Access Pattern

- **Frontend**: Uses `tauri-plugin-secure-storage` via Tauri commands
- **Backend**: Uses `keyring` crate directly for notification senders and scrapers

### Dependencies Added

```toml
tauri-plugin-secure-storage = "1.4"
keyring = { version = "3", features = [
    "apple-native",
    "windows-native",
    "sync-secret-service"
]}
```

## Breaking Changes

### Config Field Changes

The following fields in `config.json` are now ignored (credentials stored in keyring):

- `alerts.email.smtp_password`
- `alerts.telegram.bot_token`
- `alerts.slack.webhook_url`
- `alerts.discord.webhook_url`
- `alerts.teams.webhook_url`
- `linkedin.session_cookie`

### Validation Changes

Config validation no longer checks for credential presence. Credentials are validated at runtime when fetching from keyring.

---

## Settings UI Updates

The Settings page has been updated with:

- **Credential status indicators** - Shows ✅ or ⚠️ for each credential
- **Separate credential state** - Credentials managed independently from config
- **Save to keyring** - Credentials saved directly to OS keyring on form submit

---

## Test Updates

14 tests updated for new credential validation behavior:

- Validation tests now expect success (credentials validated at runtime)
- LinkedIn scraper tests expect skipped behavior when no keyring cookie
- All 2078+ tests passing (including 76 integration tests)

---

## Documentation

- **New:** [docs/security/KEYRING.md](../security/KEYRING.md) - Comprehensive keyring documentation
- **Updated:** [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)
- **Updated:** [docs/ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)

## Upgrade Path

1. **Backup your config** - `cp config.json config.json.backup`
2. **Install v2.0** - Standard installation
3. **Launch app** - Automatic migration runs on first start
4. **Verify credentials** - Check Settings page for status indicators
5. **Optional cleanup** - Remove plaintext credentials from config file
