# v2.5.2 - Bug Fixes

**Release Date:** January 24, 2026

## Overview

This patch release fixes critical bugs discovered during QA testing where onboarding
and settings were not properly saving user configurations.

## Bug Fixes

### Onboarding (SetupWizard)

1. **Slack webhook not saved** - Fixed issue where Slack webhook URL entered during
   onboarding was silently discarded. The Rust backend uses `#[serde(skip)]` for
   credentials, so they must be stored via the secure keyring API, not in config JSON.

2. **All scrapers disabled after setup** - Fixed issue where no scrapers were enabled
   after completing the setup wizard. Added default scrapers (RemoteOK, HN Who's Hiring,
   WeWorkRemotely) to the initial configuration.

3. **Desktop alerts lost when configuring Slack** - Fixed issue where enabling Slack
   notifications would disable desktop notifications. The alerts object spread was
   replacing the entire object instead of merging.

### Settings Page

1. **Missing credential types** - Added missing credential types for Discord, Teams,
   and Telegram. The frontend CredentialKey type only had 3 keys but the backend
   supports 6.

2. **No input fields for Discord/Teams/Telegram** - Users could toggle on Discord,
   Teams, and Telegram notifications but had no way to enter webhook URLs or bot
   tokens. Added the missing input fields.

## Files Changed

- `src/pages/SetupWizard.tsx` - Added credential storage, default scrapers, fixed
  alerts spread
- `src/utils/profiles.ts` - Added default scrapers to career profiles
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - Added missing credential types and input fields

## Testing

- All 2,900+ tests passing
- 87 Tauri commands verified
- Full E2E validation with 1,337 jobs scraped across 4 sources

## Upgrade Notes

No migration required. Users who experienced issues with notifications or scrapers
should:

1. Re-enter their Slack/Discord/Teams/Telegram credentials in Settings
2. Verify desired scrapers are enabled in Settings > Scrapers
