# Slack Setup (Unified)

Zero‚Äëknowledge friendly. This project can push job matches directly into Slack using an **Incoming Webhook**.

**ALPHA Disclaimer:** This automation is ALPHA. Validate behavior before relying on it. No warranty.

## üöÄ Fastest Path (Recommended)

Run the unified setup script:

```bash
python scripts/slack_setup.py
```

It will: (1) help you create (or reuse) a workspace, (2) guide manifest-based app creation, (3) enable a webhook, (4) store `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env`, and (5) send a test message.

Already have a webhook? Set it non‚Äëinteractively:

```bash
python scripts/slack_setup.py --webhook https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAA/BBB/CCC --no-test
```

Test existing config only:

```bash
python scripts/slack_setup.py --test-only
```

## Manual Setup (If You Prefer Click-Through)

If you prefer to set up Slack manually, follow these detailed steps:

### Step 1: Create a Slack Workspace (Free)

If you don't already have a Slack workspace:

1. Go to [https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew](https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew)
2. Enter your **email address** and click **Continue**
3. Check your email for a 6-digit confirmation code
4. Enter the code in Slack
5. Name your workspace (example: "My Job Search" or "Career Tools")
6. Click **Skip for now** when asked to add teammates
7. Your workspace is ready!

**Cost:** $0 (Free plan is perfect for this use case)

---

### Step 2: Create a Slack App

1. Open [https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) in your browser
2. Click the **"From an app manifest"** tab
3. Select your workspace from the dropdown menu
4. Open `config/slack_app_manifest.yml` (auto-created if missing after one run of `slack_setup.py`)
5. **Copy the entire contents** of that file
6. **Paste** it into the text box on the Slack page
7. Click **Next**
8. Review the app summary (you'll see it's called "Job Scraper Alerts")
9. Click **Create**
10. You'll see a success message!

---

### Step 3: Enable Incoming Webhooks

1. You should still be on the app settings page
2. Look for **"Incoming Webhooks"** in the left sidebar (under "Features")
3. Click it
4. Toggle the switch to **ON** (if it's not already)
5. Scroll down and click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"**
6. Select the channel where you want job alerts to go
   - **Tip:** Create a new channel called `#job-alerts` first!
   - To create a channel: In Slack, click the + next to "Channels" and name it
7. Click **Allow**
8. You'll see a webhook URL appear. It looks like:
   ```
   https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID/YOUR_CHANNEL_ID/YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
   ```
9. **Copy this entire URL** (click the "Copy" button next to it)

---

### Step 4: Add the Webhook to Configuration

Skip this section if you used `slack_setup.py` (it already wrote `.env`).

1. Create `.env` if needed.
2. Add:
   ```bash
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/WORKSPACE/CHANNEL/TOKEN
   ```
3. Save.

---

### Step 5: Test Your Setup

Use the unified script:

```bash
python scripts/slack_setup.py --test-only
```

If you need to skip network test (offline):

```bash
python scripts/slack_setup.py --webhook https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAA/BBB/CCC --no-test
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Webhook test failed"

**Problem:** The webhook URL isn't working.

**Fix:**
1. Go back to your Slack app settings
2. Navigate to **Incoming Webhooks**
3. Check if the webhook is still listed and active
4. If not, create a new one (Step 3 above)
5. Update your `.env` file with the new URL

### "No module named 'requests'"

The test step is optional. Either install it:
```bash
pip install requests
```
Or skip test:
```bash
python scripts/slack_setup.py --no-test
```

### "I don't see the test message in Slack"

**Checklist:**
1. ‚úì Did you copy the complete webhook URL (including `https://`)?
2. ‚úì Is there a space or newline character at the end of the URL in `.env`? Remove it.
3. ‚úì Did you select the correct channel when creating the webhook?
4. ‚úì Is the Slack app still installed in your workspace? (Check Apps in Slack sidebar)

### "Permission denied when accessing .env file"

**Problem:** File permissions issue.

**Fix:**
```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

## Understanding Slack Costs

### Free Plan (Recommended for Personal Use)

- **Cost:** $0/month
- **Message limit:** 90 days of message history
- **Perfect for:** Personal job search (you'll see job alerts as they arrive)

### What This Means for You

- Job alerts arrive instantly when posted
- You can see the last 90 days of alerts (plenty for job searching!)
- No cost, no credit card required

---

## Security & Privacy

### What Information Goes to Slack?

The job scraper sends:
- Job title
- Company name
- Location
- Job URL
- Match score

**It does NOT send:**
- Your resume
- Your personal information
- Your search history
- Any data about you

### Keeping Your Webhook Secure

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Your webhook URL is like a password. Anyone with it can post to your Slack channel.

**Best practices:**
1. ‚úì Never commit your `.env` file to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
2. ‚úì Don't share your webhook URL publicly
3. ‚úì If you accidentally expose it, delete the old webhook and create a new one

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Notification Format

Edit `notify/slack.py` to customize how job alerts look in Slack.

### Multiple Channels

You can create multiple webhooks for different channels (e.g., `#high-priority-jobs`, `#all-jobs`) and configure different score thresholds.

### Slack App Permissions

Manifest requests only `incoming-webhook` (send‚Äëonly). No reading channels, no user data.
