## What is JobSentinel?

JobSentinel is a tool that automatically searches for jobs and tells you about the best matches.

**Think of it like this:**
- You tell it what kind of jobs you want (keywords like "Python" or "Manager")
- It searches multiple job websites for you (while you sleep!)
- It scores each job based on how well it matches what you want
- It sends you notifications (via Slack) for really good matches
- All your data stays on your computer (nothing goes to the cloud unless you want it to)

**What makes it special:**
- ‚úÖ **Free**: No monthly subscription, no hidden costs
- ‚úÖ **Private**: Your data never leaves your computer
- ‚úÖ **Smart**: Uses AI to understand job descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Automatic**: Runs in the background
- ‚úÖ **Honest**: Won't spam you with bad job matches

## First Time Setup

The setup wizard will ask you questions. Here's what they mean:

### Question 1: Job Keywords
**"What keywords describe jobs you want?"**

Examples:
- For tech jobs: `python, backend, api, django`
- For marketing jobs: `digital marketing, social media, seo`
- For management: `project manager, team lead, scrum`

**Tip**: Think about words that would appear in your dream job posting.

### Question 2: Locations
**"Where do you want to work?"**

Examples:
- `Remote` (work from home)
- `San Francisco, CA` (specific city)
- `Remote, New York, Boston` (multiple options)

**Tip**: "Remote" is very popular and gives you the most options.

### Question 3: Minimum Salary
**"What's your minimum acceptable salary?"**

Examples:
- `100000` (for $100,000 USD per year)
- `0` (if you don't want to filter by salary)

**Tip**: Be realistic - too high and you'll miss opportunities.

### Question 4: Companies to Avoid
**"Any companies you want to exclude?" (optional)**

Examples:
- `Meta, Amazon` (if you don't want big tech)
- Leave blank if none

### Question 5: Job Sources
**"Which job boards should we search?"**

- **JobsWithGPT**: Free, no setup needed ‚úÖ Recommended
- **Reed.co.uk**: Requires free API key, UK jobs only

**Tip**: Start with just JobsWithGPT. You can add more later.

### Question 6: Slack Notifications
**"Want instant alerts?"**

If yes, you'll need:
1. A Slack workspace (create free at https://slack.com)
2. A webhook URL (the wizard will guide you)

**Don't understand Slack?** Say "no" for now. You can add it later.

### Question 7: Resume Optimization
**"Want help improving your resume?"**

Say "yes" if you want:
- Resume analysis (what's good, what needs work)
- Industry-specific suggestions
- ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility checks

Choose your industry from the list.

## Running Your First Job Search

### Method 1: One-Time Search (Recommended for first try)

1. Open Terminal/PowerShell
2. Navigate to JobSentinel folder:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/JobSentinel  # or wherever you installed it
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python -m jsa.cli run-once
   ```
4. Wait 2-5 minutes while it searches
5. Look for results in `data/jobs.db` or Slack notifications

### Method 2: Dry Run (Test Mode)
Want to see what it would do without actually saving anything?

```bash
python -m jsa.cli run-once --dry-run
```

This shows you what jobs it finds without saving them.

### Method 3: Schedule Automatic Searches
Want it to run automatically every day?

**Windows**: Use Task Scheduler (search for it in Start menu)  
**Mac**: Use `launchd` or create a cron job  
**Linux**: Use `cron`

See [Automated Scheduling Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#scheduling) for details.

## Understanding the Results

### Job Scores
Each job gets a score from 0-100:
- **90-100**: Excellent match! Apply immediately
- **75-89**: Very good match, worth investigating
- **60-74**: Decent match, review carefully
- **Below 60**: Probably not a great fit

### What Affects the Score?
1. **Keywords** (40%): Does the job mention your keywords?
2. **Salary** (25%): Does it meet your minimum?
3. **Location** (20%): Is it in your preferred locations?
4. **Company** (10%): Is it a reputable company?
5. **Freshness** (5%): How recently was it posted?

### Where to Find Jobs
- **Slack**: High-scoring jobs (80+) are sent here
- **Database**: All jobs saved in `data/jobs.db`
- **Web UI**: Run `python -m jsa.cli web` to see a dashboard

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to keep Terminal open?"
No! Once a search finishes, you can close it. For automatic searches, see scheduling guides.

### "How much does it cost?"
**Free** if you run it locally. The only costs are:
- Your electricity (pennies per month)
- Optional: Cloud hosting (~$5-15/month if you want 24/7 automation)

### "Is my data safe?"
Yes! Everything stays on your computer. JobSentinel never sends your:
- Resume
- Job preferences  
- Search history
- Personal information

To external companies (unless you choose cloud deployment).

### "Can I use this if I'm not a programmer?"
**Absolutely!** This guide is written for non-programmers. You only need to:
1. Copy/paste a few commands
2. Answer some questions
3. Let it run

No coding required!

### "What if something breaks?"
1. Check [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below
2. Run the health check: `python -m jsa.cli health`
3. Ask for help on GitHub: https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel/issues

### "Can I change settings later?"
Yes! Edit `config/user_prefs.json` with any text editor (like Notepad), or run the wizard again.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "python: command not found"
**Problem**: Python isn't installed or not in PATH.

**Fix**:
1. Reinstall Python from python.org
2. **Important**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart your terminal

---

### "Permission denied"
**Problem**: Your user account doesn't have permission.

**Fix** (Mac/Linux):
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup_wizard.py
```

---

### "Module not found"
**Problem**: A required package isn't installed.

**Fix**:
```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

---

### "No jobs found"
**Problem**: Your search criteria might be too restrictive, or job sources aren't enabled.

**Fix**:
1. Check `config/user_prefs.json`
2. Make sure at least one job source has `"enabled": true`
3. Try broader keywords
4. Lower your minimum salary

---

### "Slack notifications not working"
**Problem**: Webhook URL might be wrong, or Slack is unreachable.

**Fix**:
1. Test your webhook in a browser or with curl
2. Check `.env` file has correct `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. Make sure your internet is working

---

### "It's running very slow"
**Problem**: First run downloads ML models (~500MB).

**Fix**:
- Be patient on first run (5-10 minutes)
- Subsequent runs will be much faster (<1 minute)
- Check internet speed

---

### "Still need help?"

1. **Run Health Check**:
   ```bash
   python -m jsa.cli health --verbose
   ```
   This tells you exactly what's wrong.

2. **Check Logs**:
   Look in `logs/` folder for error details.

3. **Ask on GitHub**:
   https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel/issues

4. **Read Full Documentation**:
   See [Documentation Index](DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)
