## Pro Tips

### 1. Daily Routine

Start each day by:
1. Review "Bookmarked" - Pick 3-5 to apply today
2. Check "Applied" - Follow up on old applications
3. Prepare for "Interviewing" - Research today's interviews

### 2. Weekly Review

Every Sunday:
1. **Archive old jobs** (rejected, >30 days no response)
2. **Add new bookmarks** from job boards
3. **Update priorities** based on deadlines
4. **Review what worked** - which jobs got responses?

### 3. Batch Processing

- **Research Day** (Monday): Research 10-15 companies, bookmark best jobs
- **Application Day** (Tuesday/Wednesday): Apply to 3-5 priority jobs
- **Follow-up Day** (Thursday): Email follow-ups for applied jobs
- **Interview Prep** (Friday): Prepare for next week's interviews

### 4. Stay Organized

- ‚úÖ **Update immediately** after any action (call, email, interview)
- ‚úÖ **Use consistent naming** for documents
- ‚úÖ **Set reminders** for follow-ups (use external calendar)
- ‚úÖ **Keep notes brief** but informative
- ‚úÖ **Archive regularly** to keep board clean

### 5. Avoid Common Mistakes

- ‚ùå Don't let jobs sit in "Applied" forever - follow up or archive
- ‚ùå Don't apply to jobs you wouldn't actually take
- ‚ùå Don't forget to add contacts - they're valuable for future networking
- ‚ùå Don't skip notes - "Why did I apply here?" is a good question later
- ‚ùå Don't neglect priority updates - priorities change as you learn more
