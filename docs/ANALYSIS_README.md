## üéì Key Concepts Explained

### What is a "Job Tracker/CRM"?
**Think:** Trello board for job applications

**Features:**
- Columns: Bookmarked ‚Üí Applied ‚Üí Interviewing ‚Üí Offer
- Drag-and-drop to move jobs
- Contact management (recruiters, hiring managers)
- Document attachments (resumes, cover letters)
- Timeline of activities

**Why it matters:** 
- Teal and Huntr's #1 feature
- Fills gap between job discovery (JobSentinel ‚úÖ) and application management (missing ‚ùå)

### What is a "Browser Extension"?
**Think:** One-click "Save to JobSentinel" button

**How it works:**
1. You browse LinkedIn/Indeed/Glassdoor
2. See a job you like
3. Click extension icon
4. Job details auto-captured and saved to your tracker

**Why it matters:**
- Eliminates copy-paste workflow
- Every competitor has this
- Chrome Web Store visibility (viral growth)

### What is a "REST API"?
**Think:** Programming interface for integrations

**Enables:**
- Browser extension to save jobs
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- Zapier/Make/n8n workflows
- Third-party integrations

**Why it matters:**
- Foundation for ecosystem growth
- Standard in modern tools
- Enables automation use cases
