2. **Log files**: `Desktop/job-scraper/data/logs/` - check for errors
3. **Database**: `Desktop/job-scraper/data/jobs.sqlite` - grows as jobs are found

### **Common Issues:**

**"No jobs found"**
- Check your `title_allowlist` - might be too specific
- Verify company URLs are correct
- Run "Test Job Scraper" to check for errors

**"Notifications not working"**
- Run "Test Job Scraper" - check error messages
- Verify `.env` file has correct credentials
- Check Slack webhook URL format

**"Script not running automatically"**
- Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`)
- Check if JobScraper tasks are there and enabled
- Right-click a task ‚Üí "Run" to test manually

**"Getting too many alerts"**
- Increase `immediate_alert_threshold` (try 0.95)

- Reduce number of companies

### **Getting Help:**

1. **Check logs first**: `Desktop/job-scraper/data/logs/scraper_YYYYMMDD.log`
2. **Run health check**: Open PowerShell in the job-scraper folder, run:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe agent.py --mode health
   ```
3. **Manual test run**:
   ```powershell
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe agent.py --mode test --verbose
   ```

   ```
