## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test First
Always run with `--dry-run` first to see what it would do:
```bash
python3 -m jsa.cli run-once --dry-run
```

### Tip 2: Use Broad Keywords
Instead of: `"Senior Python Django Developer in San Francisco"`
Use: `python, django, backend`

### Tip 3: Check Regularly
Run once a day or set up with launchd (macOS task scheduler)

### Tip 4: Backup Your Data
Before major changes:
```bash
python3 -m jsa.cli backup create
```

### Tip 5: Privacy First
Your data never leaves your Mac unless YOU configure email alerts. Check anytime:
```bash
python3 -m jsa.cli privacy
```

### Tip 6: Make .command Files
Create your own shortcuts in TextEdit:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cd ~/Desktop/JobSentinel
python3 -m jsa.cli run-once
```
Save as `MyJobSearch.command`, make executable with `chmod +x MyJobSearch.command`
