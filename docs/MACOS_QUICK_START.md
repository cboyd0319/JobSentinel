## 2. Run the One-Click Installer

1. Double-click **`setup.command`**.
2. When macOS Gatekeeper asks if you are sure, choose **Open**.

   - Creates an isolated `.venv` folder so your system Python stays untouched.
   - Installs Python dependencies and Playwright Chromium.
   - Guides you through the JobSentinel preference wizard (keywords, salary, locations, notification settings).
   - Runs an automatic health check.
4. When finished, Terminal will confirm success and place several new shortcuts on your Desktop.

> ‚úÖ **No technical knowledge needed.** Every prompt explains what to do in plain language, and you can cancel at any time.

   - **Health Check** ‚Äî verify everything is running smoothly.
   - **Update Preferences** ‚Äî reopen the guided setup wizard.

2. Under **Alert**, choose **Custom‚Ä¶** ‚Üí **Open file** ‚Üí select `~/Desktop/Run JobSentinel.command`.
3. Calendar will now open the command automatically at the scheduled time.

### Option B: `launchd` (power users)

1. Open **TextEdit**, set it to plain text, and paste the following (update paths as needed):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

## 5. Troubleshooting Essentials
