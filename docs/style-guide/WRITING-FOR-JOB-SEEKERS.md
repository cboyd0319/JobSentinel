# Writing for job seekers

Job hunting is stressful. Your words can make it easier or harder. This guide helps you write with empathy.

## Understand your reader

### They're busy

Job seekers are juggling applications, interviews, and often a current job. They don't have time to read long explanations.

**Do:** Get to the point fast.

**Don't:** Write lengthy introductions or repeat yourself.

### They're stressed

Unemployment is scary. Even employed job seekers feel pressure. Your tone matters.

**Do:** Be encouraging without being fake.

**Don't:** Use pressure tactics ("Don't miss out!") or make them feel behind.

### They come from all backgrounds

A laid-off accountant and a recent graduate have different experiences. A career changer might not know industry jargon.

**Do:** Explain things clearly without assuming prior knowledge.

**Don't:** Use insider language or assume everyone knows what you know.

## Writing principles

### Lead with benefits, not features

Job seekers care about results, not technology.

| Feature-focused | Benefit-focused |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| "Multi-threaded scraping engine" | "Find jobs faster" |
| "SQLite local database" | "Your data stays on your computer" |
| "Webhook integrations" | "Get alerts where you already are" |

### Use the active voice

Active voice is clearer and more direct.

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "Jobs can be filtered by..." | "Filter jobs by..." |
| "The application was submitted" | "You submitted the application" |
| "Notifications will be sent" | "You'll get notifications" |

### Be specific

Vague language doesn't help anyone.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "JobSentinel helps you" | "JobSentinel checks 13 job boards every hour" |
| "Save time" | "Stop refreshing job boards manually" |
| "Better results" | "See jobs ranked by how well they match your skills" |

### Show, don't tell

Instead of saying something is easy, just explain how to do it.

| Telling | Showing |
|---------|---------|
| "It's easy to set up notifications" | "To set up notifications: 1. Click Settings 2. Choose Notifications 3. Pick where you want alerts" |
| "The interface is intuitive" | (Just show a screenshot or describe the layout) |

## Tone examples

### Welcoming new users

**Good:**
> "Welcome to JobSentinel. Let's get you set up so you can start finding jobs that match what you're looking for."

**Not great:**
> "Welcome to JobSentinel! You're going to LOVE this app! It's so easy to use!"

### Explaining a feature

**Good:**
> "JobSentinel checks job boards automatically so you don't have to. Set how often you want it to
> look for new jobs, and it'll do the rest."

**Not great:**
> "The automated scraping functionality leverages multi-threaded parallel processing to aggregate
> postings from disparate sources at configurable intervals."

### When something goes wrong

**Good:**
> "We couldn't connect to LinkedIn. This sometimes happens when the site is busy. Try again in a
> few minutes, or check your internet connection."

**Not great:**
> "Error: Connection timeout. LinkedIn API endpoint unreachable. Status code 503."

### Encouraging action

**Good:**
> "Ready to start? Set up your first job search and we'll start finding matches for you."

**Not great:**
> "Don't wait! Thousands of jobs are being posted RIGHT NOW and you're missing them!"

## Things to avoid

### Tech jargon

Unless you're writing for developers, skip it.

- API, SDK, CLI
- Database, query, schema
- Parse, render, compile
- Backend, frontend, stack

### Corporate speak

Real people don't talk like press releases.

- "Leverage"
- "Synergy"
- "Best-in-class"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Revolutionary"

### Absolutes that might not be true

- "The best" (says who?)
- "Guaranteed" (can you actually guarantee it?)
- "Always" (really, always?)
- "Never miss" (technology fails sometimes)

### Condescending phrases

These make readers feel stupid:

- "Simply..."
- "Just..."
- "Obviously..."
- "As you know..."
- "It's easy, just..."

### Anxiety-inducing language

Job seekers are stressed enough:

- "Don't fall behind"
- "Your competition is..."
- "Time is running out"
- "You're missing opportunities"

## Checklist before publishing

Ask yourself:

- [ ] Would a stressed job seeker understand this immediately?
- [ ] Did I avoid jargon and tech terms?
- [ ] Is it short enough to read on a phone?
- [ ] Does it help the reader do something?
- [ ] Would I be comfortable saying this to someone who just got laid off?

## Examples from our docs

### Before (too technical)

> "Configure the scheduler cron expression to define the frequency at which the scraping jobs
> execute. The default interval of 3600 seconds can be modified in the configuration JSON."

### After (user-friendly)

> "Choose how often JobSentinel looks for new jobs. The default is every hour, but you can change this in Settings."

---

### Before (too formal)

> "Users who wish to receive notifications regarding new employment opportunities should proceed
> to the notification configuration panel."

### After (conversational)

> "Want alerts when new jobs match your search? Go to Settings and pick how you'd like to be notified."

---

### Before (too salesy)

> "JobSentinel's revolutionary AI-powered ghost detection algorithm will transform your job search forever!"

### After (honest and helpful)

> "Some job postings are fake or already filled. JobSentinel flags these so you don't waste time on them."
