## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test First
Always run with `--dry-run` first to see what it would do:
```powershell
python -m jsa.cli run-once --dry-run
```

### Tip 2: Use Broad Keywords
Instead of: `"Senior Python Django Developer in San Francisco"`
Use: `python, django, backend`

### Tip 3: Check Regularly
Run once a day or set up Windows Task Scheduler:
```
Task Scheduler ‚Üí Create Basic Task ‚Üí Daily ‚Üí Run program:
    python -m jsa.cli run-once
```

### Tip 4: Backup Your Data
Before major changes:
```powershell
python -m jsa.cli backup create
```

### Tip 5: Privacy First
Your data never leaves your computer unless YOU configure email alerts. Check anytime:
```powershell
python -m jsa.cli privacy
```
