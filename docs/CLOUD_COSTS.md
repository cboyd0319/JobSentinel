## Security Cost Analysis üîê

### Personal Account Security Scanning (Future Feature)

We should add a cloud security scanner that checks friends' personal accounts for:

#### AWS Personal Account Issues:
- Root account with no MFA ‚ùå
- Overly permissive IAM policies ‚ùå
- Public S3 buckets ‚ùå
- No billing alerts ‚ùå
- Unused/excessive permissions ‚ùå

#### GCP Personal Account Issues:  
- No organization policies ‚ùå
- Public storage buckets ‚ùå
- No budget alerts ‚ùå
- Overprivileged service accounts ‚ùå

#### Azure Personal Account Issues:
- No resource locks ‚ùå
- Public storage accounts ‚ùå
- No spending limits ‚ùå
- Excessive contributor permissions ‚ùå

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Use cloud provider APIs to scan configurations
2. Generate friendly, actionable reports
3. Provide one-click fixes where possible
4. Weekly security check reminders

## Deployment Recommendations by User Type

### Technical Friends
- **Primary:** Google Cloud Run
- **Backup:** AWS Lambda
- **Why:** Familiar with cloud concepts, want reliability

### Non-Technical Friends  
- **Primary:** Railway.app
- **Backup:** Oracle Cloud Always Free
- **Why:** Simple deployment, generous free tiers

### Privacy-Conscious Friends
- **Primary:** Oracle Cloud Always Free  
- **Backup:** Self-hosted on personal hardware
- **Why:** No vendor lock-in, maximum control

### Cost-Sensitive Friends
- **Primary:** Oracle Cloud Always Free
- **Backup:** Google Cloud Run  
- **Why:** Truly free forever vs. very generous free tier

## Hidden Costs to Watch

### Data Transfer Costs
- **Most providers:** First 1TB/month free
- **Job scraper usage:** ~100MB/month typical
- **Risk:** Very low

### Storage Costs  
- **SQLite database:** ~50MB after 1 year
- **Log files:** ~500MB after 1 year  
- **Cloud storage:** Usually $0.02-0.05/GB/month
- **Monthly cost:** <$0.50

### API Costs (AI-Enhanced Mode)
- **OpenAI GPT-4:** ~$0.30 per 1M tokens
- **Typical usage:** 100-500 job descriptions/month
- **Monthly cost:** $2-10 for AI features

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1:** Google Cloud Run deployment template
2. **Phase 2:** AWS Lambda template  
3. **Phase 3:** Oracle Cloud template
4. **Phase 4:** Personal account security scanner
5. **Phase 5:** Cost monitoring and alerts

## One-Click Security Fixes

Future feature: Automated security hardening

```bash
# Example security fixes
./install.sh --cloud-deploy gcp --harden-security
```

This would automatically:
- Enable MFA requirements
- Set up billing alerts  
- Configure least-privilege IAM
- Enable audit logging
- Set up monitoring alerts
