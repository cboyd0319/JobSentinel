# Roadmap ideas

Here are a bunch of ideas I might work on eventually. No promises — just a list of things I'd like to try if I get time or help.

- Better AI features (resume matching, interview prep, etc.)
- More scrapers (LinkedIn, AngelList, freelance sites)
- Automation helpers (auto-fill, resume tweaks) — only if users want it
- Mobile notifications and a tiny web UI
- Privacy tools (export data, better `.env` handling)
- Performance improvements and smarter rate limiting

If you care about any of these, file an issue or a PR and tell me why — that helps me prioritize.
