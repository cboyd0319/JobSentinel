# Roadmap ideas

Here’s the running list of things I’m curious about exploring. No schedule, just a parking lot of ideas.

## Done recently

- Wired up CodeQL, Safety, and Bandit so the security checks match what I run locally
- Added OSV scanning and SARIF uploads so GitHub’s Security tab stays current
- Tidied the cloud bootstrapper with budget alerts and Binary Authorization

## Up next (maybe)

- Bring the nicer Cloud Run bootstrapper experience to AWS Lambda and Azure Functions
- Keep hammering on the Windows setup script until it feels as smooth as macOS/Linux
- Expand CI to cover more scraping edge cases and make rollback easier

## Nice-to-haves for later

- Smarter AI helpers (resume hints, matcher explanations)
- More scrapers for sites friends keep asking about
- Lightweight mobile or web notifications
- Better privacy tooling (data export, key rotation reminders)
- Full encryption of data in transit and at rest

If one of these matters to you, open an issue with context. Knowing why you need it helps me decide what to tackle next.
