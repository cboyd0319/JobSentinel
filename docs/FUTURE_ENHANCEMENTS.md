# Roadmap ideas

Here are a bunch of ideas I might work on eventually. No promises â€” just a list of things I'd like to try if I get time or help.

## âœ… Completed Recently (September 2025)

**Enterprise-Grade Security Implementation:**
- âœ… **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code vulnerability detection
- âœ… **OSV Scanner**: Google's comprehensive vulnerability database integration
- âœ… **Enhanced Security Scanning**: Bandit, Safety, and TruffleHog integration (Ruff planned)
- âœ… **SARIF Format**: Proper Security tab integration for all vulnerability data
- âœ… **Local Validation Tools**: Comprehensive security validation pipeline
- âœ… **Supply Chain Security**: Build provenance attestation and dependency reviews
- âœ… **Configuration Validation**: YAML and shell script security analysis

## ðŸš€ Next Priority Items

**Windows Setup Hardening:**
- ðŸ”„ **Rock-solid Windows Installation**: PowerShell script testing and validation
- ðŸ”„ **Cross-platform Consistency**: Ensure identical experience across macOS/Linux/Windows
- ðŸ”„ **Dependency Management**: Robust Python environment setup on Windows

**Development Infrastructure:**
- **Enhanced CI/CD**: Automated testing, deployment, and rollback capabilities
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time job scraping performance and health metrics
- **Error Recovery**: Improved resilience and automatic recovery from failures

## ðŸ’¡ Future Feature Ideas

- Better AI features (resume matching, interview prep, etc.)
- More scrapers (LinkedIn, AngelList, freelance sites)
- Automation helpers (auto-fill, resume tweaks) â€” only if users want it
- Mobile notifications and a tiny web UI
- Privacy tools (export data, better `.env` handling)
- Performance improvements and smarter rate limiting

If you care about any of these, file an issue or a PR and tell me why â€” that helps me prioritize.
