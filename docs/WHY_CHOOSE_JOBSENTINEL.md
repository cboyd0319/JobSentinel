## Unique Features ONLY JobSentinel Has

### 1. Privacy Dashboard (INDUSTRY FIRST)

**What it does:** Shows you EXACTLY what data is stored and where.

**Why it matters:** Commercial tools say "we respect privacy" but give you NO PROOF. JobSentinel shows you every byte of data with PII identification.

**Example:**
```
üìÅ Data Storage Locations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Job Data
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobs (2,451 records, 42.1 MB)

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ applications üîê (47 records, 156 KB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User Preferences
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ user_prefs.json üîê (1 record, 2.4 KB)

‚úÖ Privacy Guarantees
‚Ä¢ All data stored locally on your machine
‚Ä¢ No telemetry or analytics sent anywhere
‚Ä¢ No third-party tracking scripts
‚Ä¢ You own and control 100% of your data
```

**Command:**
```bash
python -m jsa.cli privacy
```

**Competition:** ZERO other tools offer this.

---

### 2. Backup & Restore with Integrity Verification

**What it does:** One-click backup of ALL data with SHA-256 checksums.

---

### 3. Zero-Admin Auto-Update (WINDOWS-FIRST)

- Works WITHOUT admin rights

**Command:**
```bash
python -m jsa.cli update --check-only    # Check for updates
