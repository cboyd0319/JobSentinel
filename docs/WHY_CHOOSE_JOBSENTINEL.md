## Unique Features ONLY JobSentinel Has

### 1. Privacy Dashboard (INDUSTRY FIRST)

**What it does:** Shows you EXACTLY what data is stored and where.

**Why it matters:** Commercial tools say "we respect privacy" but give you NO PROOF. JobSentinel shows you every byte of data with PII identification.

**Example:**
```
📁 Data Storage Locations
├── Job Data
│   ├── jobs (2,451 records, 42.1 MB)
│   ├── scores (2,451 records, 1.2 MB)
│   └── applications 🔐 (47 records, 156 KB)
└── User Preferences
    └── user_prefs.json 🔐 (1 record, 2.4 KB)

✅ Privacy Guarantees
• All data stored locally on your machine
• No telemetry or analytics sent anywhere
• No third-party tracking scripts
• You own and control 100% of your data
```

**Command:**
```bash
python -m jsa.cli privacy
```

**Competition:** ZERO other tools offer this.

---

### 2. Backup & Restore with Integrity Verification

**What it does:** One-click backup of ALL data with SHA-256 checksums.

**Why it matters:** 
- Commercial tools: "Pay us or lose your data"
- JobSentinel: "Free forever, portable standard formats"

**Features:**
- Standard tar.gz format (open anywhere)
- SHA-256 checksums (verify data integrity)
- 70-80% compression

```

**Competition:** 
- Teal/Huntr: ❌ No backup (cloud only)

- Manual: ❌ N/A

---

### 3. Zero-Admin Auto-Update (WINDOWS-FIRST)

- Health check after update
- Rollback if needed
- Works WITHOUT admin rights

**Command:**
```bash
python -m jsa.cli update --check-only    # Check for updates

python -m jsa.cli update --auto          # Auto-update
```

**Competition:**

- AIHawk: Manual git pull (requires git knowledge)
- Others: N/A

---

### 4. Email Alerts (No Slack Required!)
