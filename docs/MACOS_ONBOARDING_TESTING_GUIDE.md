# macOS Onboarding Experience - Testing & Validation Guide

This document describes how to test and validate the complete macOS onboarding experience for JobSentinel.

## Overview

The macOS onboarding has been redesigned for users with **ZERO technical knowledge**. Everything is accessible through double-clickable `.command` files.

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Installation Testing

#### 1. Prerequisites Check

Test the **Check Python.command** helper:

```bash
cd deploy/local/macos
open check-python.command
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Opens Terminal automatically
- Shows Python version if installed
- Shows friendly install instructions if Python missing
- Waits for user to press Enter before closing

**Test scenarios:**
- ‚úÖ Python 3.12 installed ‚Üí Shows "‚úÖ Found: Python 3.12.x"
- ‚úÖ Python 3.11 installed ‚Üí Shows "‚úÖ Found: Python 3.11.x"
- ‚ùå No Python ‚Üí Shows install instructions with links

---

### Installation Testing

#### 2. Setup Wizard

Test the main **setup.command** installer:

```bash
cd deploy/local/macos
open setup.command
```

**Expected flow:**
1. **Gatekeeper warning** (first run only)
   - User gets "unidentified developer" warning
   - User Control-clicks ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Opens successfully
   
2. **System checks** (automatic)
   - ‚úÖ macOS version check (12+ required, 14+ recommended)
   - ‚úÖ Python version check (3.11+ required, 3.12+ recommended)
   - ‚úÖ Disk space check (1GB+ required)
   - ‚úÖ Internet connection check

3. **Virtual environment creation** (automatic)
   - Creates `.venv` directory in project root
   - Shows progress: "Creating virtual environment (this happens once)..."
   - On subsequent runs: "Existing virtual environment detected - reusing it."

4. **Dependency installation** (automatic)
   - Updates pip, setuptools, wheel
   - Installs JobSentinel package in development mode

6. **Configuration wizard** (interactive)
   - Asks for job search keywords
   - Asks for preferred locations
   - Asks for salary requirements
   - Asks for notification preferences
   - Creates `deploy/common/config/user_prefs.json`

7. **Health check** (automatic)
   - Verifies all components installed correctly
   - Tests database connectivity
   - Shows green checkmarks for each component

8. **Desktop shortcut creation** (automatic)

     - `Run JobSentinel.command`
     - `JobSentinel Dashboard.command`
     - `Configure JobSentinel.command`
     - `JobSentinel Launcher.command` (GUI)
     - `JobSentinel Health Check.command`
     - `JobSentinel Dry Run.command`

9. **Success message**
   - Shows next steps with example commands
   - Waits for user to press Enter before closing

**Test scenarios:**
- ‚úÖ Fresh install ‚Üí All steps complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Re-run after failed install ‚Üí Resumes where it left off
- ‚úÖ Re-run after successful install ‚Üí Skips completed steps
- ‚ùå No internet ‚Üí Fails at dependency installation with helpful message
- ‚ùå Not enough disk space ‚Üí Fails at disk check with clear message
- ‚ùå Python too old ‚Üí Fails at Python check with upgrade instructions

### User Experience Testing

#### 6. Zero-Knowledge User Simulation

Test with someone who has:
- Never used Terminal before
- Doesn't know what "command line" means
- Has basic Mac usage skills (Finder, double-clicking)

**Test flow:**
1. Give them the JobSentinel folder
2. Tell them: "Double-click setup.command in deploy/local/macos"
3. Observe WITHOUT helping
4. Note any confusion or errors

**Success criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Completes setup without asking for help
- ‚úÖ Understands all prompts and messages
- ‚úÖ Can find and launch GUI afterward
- ‚úÖ Can run first job search
- ‚úÖ Understands notification results

**Common issues to watch for:**
- ‚ùå Gatekeeper warning scares them (add reassurance in docs)
- ‚ùå Doesn't know what "keywords" means (add examples)
- ‚ùå Confused about notifications (add test button)
- ‚ùå Can't find Desktop shortcuts (verify they were created)

### Performance Testing

#### 7. Timing Benchmarks

Measure time for each phase:

| Phase | Expected Time | Acceptable Range |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| System checks | 5 seconds | 3-10 seconds |
| Venv creation | 10 seconds | 5-30 seconds |
| pip upgrade | 15 seconds | 10-30 seconds |
| Package install | 2 minutes | 1-5 minutes |
| Playwright install | 1 minute | 30s-3 minutes |
| Config wizard | Variable | User-paced |
| Health check | 5 seconds | 3-10 seconds |
| Shortcut creation | 2 seconds | 1-5 seconds |
| **Total (automated)** | **4 minutes** | **2-9 minutes** |

```
Expected:
- Paths are properly quoted with shlex.quote()
- No code injection possible
- Script fails safely if path invalid

**B. Subprocess security**
- [ ] All subprocess calls use list arguments (not strings)
- [ ] No shell=True unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] All paths validated before use
- [ ] All `# nosec` comments have justifications

**C. File permissions**
- [ ] .command files are executable (755)
- [ ] Config files are user-readable only (600)
- [ ] .venv directory is user-owned
- [ ] No world-writable files created

### Regression Testing

#### 10. Existing Functionality

Ensure nothing broke:

- [ ] Command-line `jsa.cli` still works
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Web dashboard still accessible
- [ ] Database migrations work
- [ ] Notification system works
- [ ] Job scrapers work
- [ ] Configuration schema unchanged (or backward compatible)
