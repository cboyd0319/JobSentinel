## ü™ü Windows Installation (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Download JobSentinel

**Option A: Easy Way (Recommended for Beginners)**

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. Go to: https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel
3. Look for a green button that says **"Code"**
4. Click it, then click **"Download ZIP"**
5. The file will download (usually goes to your Downloads folder)

**Option B: Using Git (If You Know How)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cboyd0319/JobSentinel.git
```

### Step 2: Extract the ZIP File

1. Open your **Downloads** folder
2. Find the file called `JobSentinel-main.zip`
3. **Right-click** on it
4. Choose **"Extract All..."**
5. Click **"Extract"**
6. A new folder called `JobSentinel-main` will appear

### Step 3: Run the Installer

1. Open the `JobSentinel-main` folder
2. Look for a folder called `scripts`
3. Inside, find a file called `install.py`
4. **Right-click** on `install.py`
5. Choose **"Open With" ‚Üí "Python"**
   - If you don't see Python, that's okay! The installer will help you get it.

**What Happens Next:**
- A black window will appear (this is normal!)
- You'll see messages like "Installing Python..." or "Setting up JobSentinel..."
- This takes about 10-15 minutes
- **Do not close this window!** Just wait for it to finish.

### Step 4: First-Time Setup

Once the installation finishes, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ Installation Complete!
Would you like to configure JobSentinel now? (y/n):
```

1. Type `y` and press Enter
2. You'll be asked some questions:

**Question 1: What kind of jobs are you looking for?**
```
Example answers:

```
Answer: y (yes) or n (no)
```

If yes, you'll need a "webhook URL" (don't worry, we'll show you how to get this in the FAQ).

You should see a list of files and folders. If you see `install.py`, you're in the right place!

### Step 5: Run the Installer

```bash
python3 scripts/install.py
```

**What Happens:**
- Terminal will show messages like "Installing dependencies..."
- Takes about 10-15 minutes

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### "I don't have Python installed. What do I do?"

**Don't worry!** The installer (`install.py`) will automatically install Python for you. Just double-click it and follow the prompts.

### "The installer says 'Permission Denied'"

**On Windows:**
- Right-click `install.py` ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.py
python3 scripts/install.py
```

### "I see a lot of red text during installation"

Most of the time, red text is just warnings - not errors. The installer will tell you if something actually failed. Look for:
- ‚ùå (red X) = Something went wrong
- ‚úÖ (green check) = Everything is fine

### "How do I know if it's working?"

Run this command:
```bash
python -m jsa.cli health
```

If you see:
```
HEALTH ok total_jobs=0 high_score_jobs=0
```
Everything is working! The zeros are normal - you haven't searched for jobs yet.

### "What if I make a mistake during setup?"

**No problem!** You can always reconfigure:

**Windows:**
```bash
cd JobSentinel-main
python -m jsa.cli config-validate
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd JobSentinel
python3 -m jsa.cli config-validate
```

## üÜò Something Went Wrong?

### Error: "Python not found"

**Windows:**
1. Download Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart your computer
4. Try again

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew first (package manager)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Python
brew install python@3.13
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install python3.13 python3.13-venv
```

### Error: "Not enough disk space"

You need at least 2 GB free. To free up space:

**Windows:**
1. Open **Settings** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Storage**
2. Click **"Temporary files"**
3. Check the boxes and click **"Remove files"**

**Mac:**
1. Open **Finder** ‚Üí **Go** ‚Üí **Computer**
2. Right-click your hard drive ‚Üí **Get Info**
3. Empty Trash and delete old files

### Error: "Antivirus blocked installation"

This is common with security software. Tell your antivirus that JobSentinel is safe:

**Windows Defender:**
1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection** ‚Üí **Manage settings**
3. Under **Exclusions**, click **"Add or remove exclusions"**
4. Click **"Add an exclusion"** ‚Üí **"Folder"**
