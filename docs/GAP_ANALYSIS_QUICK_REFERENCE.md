## 🚀 90-Day Plan to #1

### Week 1-4: Mobile App (React Native)
- ✅ Authentication + job browsing
- ✅ Save jobs + track applications
- ✅ Push notifications for high matches
- ✅ Offline-first sync

### Week 2-8: Modern Web UI (React)
- ✅ Kanban board for application tracking
- ✅ Interactive job feed with filters
- ✅ Analytics dashboard
- ✅ Real-time updates

### Week 4-7: REST API (FastAPI)
- ✅ CRUD endpoints for jobs/applications
- ✅ Webhook delivery system
- ✅ API key management
- ✅ OpenAPI/Swagger docs

### Week 6-10: LLM Integration
- ✅ Cover letter generation (local Llama fallback)
- ✅ Job description insights
- ✅ Interview question prep
- ✅ Cost controls (<$10/month)

**Total:** 10 weeks parallel (2 devs) or 17 weeks sequential (1 dev)

---

## 💰 Investment & Returns

**Phase 1 Investment:** 90 developer-days (3 months @ 1 FTE)

**Expected Returns:**
- User growth: 50 → 500 weekly users (+10x)
- GitHub stars: 100 → 1,000 (+10x)
- Market position: #2 → #1
- Feature completeness: 59% → 91% (+32 points)

**ROI:** High confidence (technical foundation ready, clear requirements)

---

## ⚠️ Risk Level

**Overall Risk:** ✅ LOW

- ✅ Technical: Clear scope, proven tech stack (React Native, React, FastAPI)
- ✅ Resource: Well-defined effort (4-6 week chunks)
- ✅ Market: User feedback confirms demand
- ⚠️ Scope creep: Mitigation = strict MVP definition

---

## 📋 Decision Framework

### Proceed with Phase 1 if:
- ✅ Goal is mass-market adoption (not just technical users)
- ✅ Resources available: 1 developer for 3 months
- ✅ Strategic commitment to #1 market position

### Skip mobile/UI if:
- ❌ Target market is technical users only (<5% market)
- ❌ Privacy-first enterprise focus (self-hosted CLI)
- ❌ Resource constraints (maintain status quo)
