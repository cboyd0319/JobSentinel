## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level:** ✅ LOW (high confidence)

**Technical Risk:** ✅ LOW
- Clear requirements and scope
- Proven technology stack (React Native, React, FastAPI)
- Strong technical foundation (no blocking technical debt)

**Resource Risk:** ✅ LOW
- Well-defined effort (4-6 week chunks)
- Can be done with 1 developer over 3 months
- Parallel work possible with 2 developers

**Market Risk:** ✅ LOW
- User feedback validates demand
- Competitive window is open (AIHawk focuses on LinkedIn, commercial tools expensive)
- No major competitor threats in privacy-first segment

**Execution Risk:** ⚠️ MEDIUM
- Potential scope creep (mitigation: strict MVP definition)
- Mobile app maintenance (mitigation: React Native code sharing)
- Priority decisions (mitigation: data-driven approach)

**Overall Assessment:** HIGH CONFIDENCE in successful execution

## 📋 Decision Framework

### Proceed with Phase 1 if:
- ✅ Goal is **mass-market adoption** (not just technical users)
- ✅ Resources available: **1 developer for 3 months**
- ✅ Strategic commitment to **#1 market position**
- ✅ Willing to invest in **mobile + modern UI**

### Acceptable to defer/skip if:
- ❌ Target market is **technical users only** (<5% of job seekers)
- ❌ Focus is **privacy-first enterprise** (self-hosted CLI acceptable)
- ❌ Resource constraints limit to **CLI/web only**
- ❌ Strategic focus is **feature depth** over user adoption
