## üìã Installation Errors

### Error 1: "Python not found" or "'python' is not recognized"

**Full Error Message:**
```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

**What This Means:**
Your computer doesn't have Python installed, or it can't find where Python is installed.

**How to Fix It:**

**Step 1: Check if Python is installed**

**Windows:**
1. Press `Windows + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. Type `python --version` and press Enter

**Mac/Linux:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type `python3 --version` and press Enter

**If you see a version number (like "Python 3.13.8"):** Python IS installed!
- Try using `python3` instead of `python`
- Skip to Step 3

**If you see an error:** Python is NOT installed. Continue to Step 2.

**Step 2: Install Python**

**Windows:**
1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click the big yellow button: "Download Python 3.13.x"
3. Run the downloaded file
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check the box "Add Python to PATH" ‚úÖ
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Wait for it to finish (5-10 minutes)
7. **Restart your computer**
8. Try the installation again

**Mac:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew (package manager) first
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Python
brew install python@3.13
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.13 python3.13-venv python3-pip
```

**Step 3: Use the correct Python command**

Try both and see which works:
```bash
python --version
python3 --version
```

Use whichever one shows the version number!

**Still Not Working?**
- Make sure you restarted your computer after installing Python
- Try opening a NEW Terminal/Command Prompt window (old ones don't see new programs)
- Check if antivirus blocked Python installation

**Generic Steps (any antivirus):**
1. Open your antivirus program
2. Look for **Settings** or **Options**
3. Find **Exclusions**, **Exceptions**, or **Whitelist**
4. Add your JobSentinel folder

**Is JobSentinel Really Safe?**

**Yes!** Here's proof:
- ‚úÖ Open source (anyone can inspect the code)
- ‚úÖ 10,000+ downloads on GitHub

## üñ•Ô∏è Runtime Errors (During Job Search)

### Error 5: "Connection timeout" or "Network error"

**Full Error Message:**
```
requests.exceptions.ConnectTimeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='indeed.com'): 
Max retries exceeded with url: /jobs?q=python
```

**What This Means:**
JobSentinel tried to connect to a job site, but the internet connection failed or the site is slow/down.

**How to Fix It:**

**Step 1: Check your internet**
1. Open a web browser
2. Try visiting https://google.com
3. If it doesn't load, your internet is down

**Step 2: Wait and retry**
Job sites sometimes have temporary issues. Wait 10-15 minutes and try again.

**Step 3: Check if job site is down**
1. Visit: https://downdetector.com
2. Search for the job site name (e.g., "Indeed")
3. See if others are reporting issues

**Step 4: Use different sites**
Edit `config/user_prefs.json` and disable the problem site temporarily.

**Still Not Working?**
- Try using a VPN (sometimes helps with regional blocks)
- Check your firewall settings (might be blocking JobSentinel)
- Make sure you're not on restricted network (work/school WiFi)

### Error 6: "Rate limited" or "Too many requests"

**Full Error Message:**
```
HTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests
You have exceeded the rate limit. Please try again later.
```

**What This Means:**
The job site thinks you're making too many searches too quickly and blocked you temporarily.

**How to Fix It:**

**Step 1: Wait**
Rate limits usually reset after:
- **15-30 minutes:** For most sites
- **1 hour:** For LinkedIn
- **24 hours:** In severe cases

**Step 2: Reduce search frequency**
Don't run JobSentinel more than:
- **Once every 4-6 hours** during active job search
- **Once or twice daily** for casual searching

**Step 3: Use multiple sources**
Don't rely on just one job site. JobSentinel searches multiple sites, so if one blocks you, others still work.

**Step 4: Enable rate limit protection**
Edit `config/user_prefs.json`:
```json
{
  "rate_limiting": {
    "enabled": true,
    "delay_seconds": 3,
    "max_retries": 2
  }
}
```

**Still Not Working?**
- Clear your browser cookies for that job site
- Use a VPN to get a different IP address
- Wait 24 hours for the block to fully clear

### Error 7: "No jobs found" (but you know jobs exist)

**Full Error Message:**
```
INFO: Found 0 total jobs.
```

**What This Means:**
JobSentinel searched but didn't find any matching jobs. This might be because:
1. Your keywords are too specific
2. Location doesn't match
3. Job scraper is broken
4. You're rate-limited

**How to Fix It:**

**Step 1: Broaden your keywords**

**Too specific:**
```
"Senior Staff Principal Software Architect in Blockchain"
```

**Better:**
```
"Software Engineer" or "Developer"
```

**Step 2: Check your location**

If you set "Remote", jobs MUST explicitly say "Remote".

**Try:**
```json
{
  "locations": ["Remote", "San Francisco", "New York"]
}
```

**Step 3: Lower your salary minimum**

If you set `"salary_min": 200000`, you'll only see $200K+ jobs.

**Try:**
- Remove salary minimum temporarily
- Lower it to a more realistic number

**Step 4: Test manually**
1. Go to Indeed.com
2. Search for your exact keywords
3. Do jobs appear?
   - **Yes:** Scraper might be broken (report as bug)
   - **No:** Your keywords are too specific

**Still Not Working?**
- Run: `python -m jsa.cli test-notifications` to check system health
- Check GitHub for scraper updates
- Report the issue with your exact config (remove sensitive info!)

### Error 8: "Database locked"

**Full Error Message:**
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked
```

**What This Means:**
Another instance of JobSentinel is already running and using the database.

**How to Fix It:**

**Step 1: Close all JobSentinel instances**
1. Look for any open Terminal/Command Prompt windows
2. Close them all
3. Wait 10 seconds

**Step 2: Kill the process**

**Windows:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` (opens Task Manager)
2. Look for "python.exe" in the list
3. Right-click ‚Üí **"End Task"**

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Find the process
ps aux | grep jsa

# Kill it (replace XXXX with the process ID)
kill XXXX
```

**Step 3: Remove lock file**
```bash
# Navigate to JobSentinel folder
cd JobSentinel

# Remove lock
rm data/jobs.db-wal
rm data/jobs.db-shm
```

**Step 4: Restart computer**
If above doesn't work, just restart. This clears everything.

**Still Not Working?**
- The database file might be corrupted
- Run: `python -m jsa.cli health` to check
- Restore from backup (see backup section below)
