## Why Archive?

These documents were moved to `docs/archive/` because:

1. **Content duplicated** — Information now in multiple current docs
2. **Implementation details** — Too specific for general users, useful for maintainers
3. **Historical context** — Show project evolution but no longer actionable
4. **Superseded** — Newer documents have better organization

## Using Archived Docs

**For developers:** Reference implementation decisions and original context  
**For maintainers:** Understand why certain patterns were chosen  
**For historians:** See project evolution and learnings

**Don't use for:**
- Current setup instructions (may be outdated)
- Production deployment (may have outdated steps)
- Security guidance (may miss latest improvements)
