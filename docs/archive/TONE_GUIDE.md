# Tone Guide — Personal Project

This is a short, informal style guide for making the docs feel like a single developer's personal project rather than a corporate/team product.

## Voice

- Friendly, concise, and pragmatic. Write like you're explaining the project to a peer or to friends who might use it someday.
- Use "I" where appropriate (this is a personal project). Use "you" for direct instructions or tips.
- Keep it casual but clear — avoid marketing language like "enterprise-grade" or "zero maintenance" unless it's factual and necessary.

## Do

- Use short sentences and concrete steps.
- Be honest about stability and trade-offs.
- Keep configuration and commands clear and copy-pasteable.
- Keep legal/licensing text factual and unchanged.

## Don't

- Don't use corporate buzzwords ("enterprise", "resilience features", "stakeholders").
- Don't overpromise — prefer measured, testable claims.

## Examples

- Corporate: "A robust, enterprise-grade job monitoring service that runs entirely on your own machine"
- Personal: "A local job-scraper I built to watch job boards and notify me about matches"
- Corporate: "Zero-maintenance system with self-healing capabilities"
- Personal: "Designed to recover from common errors, but you should still watch the logs"

## How to apply

- Start with the `README.md` — make it inviting and personal.
- Keep technical docs (installation, security) accurate but relax the marketing tone.
- Preserve legal or community-required files (LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT) but adjust wording where it helps the personal voice.

"Ship early, document simply."
